# Contributing to Agent Paradise Standards System

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agent-paradise-standards-system.git
cd agent-paradise-standards-system

# 2. Set up development environment
just init

# 3. Make your changes...

# 4. Run checks before committing
just check

# 5. Commit with conventional message
git commit -m "feat: add my awesome feature"

# 6. Push and open PR
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.85+** — Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Just** — Task runner: `cargo install just`

### Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just check` | Format, lint, and test |
| `just build` | Build all crates |
| `just aps-validate` | Validate all standards |
| `just aps-list` | List discovered packages |

## Creating a New Standard

All new standards start as **experiments** to allow iteration before promotion.

### 1. Create an Experiment

```bash
aps v1 create experiment my-idea
```

This scaffolds:
```
standards-experimental/v1/EXP-V1-XXXX-my-idea/
├── experiment.toml
├── docs/
│   ├── 00_overview.md
│   └── 01_spec.md
├── examples/
├── tests/
├── agents/skills/
├── src/lib.rs
└── Cargo.toml
```

### 2. Implement Required Structure

Every standard must include:

- **`docs/01_spec.md`** — Core specification
- **`examples/`** — At least one working example
- **`tests/`** — Automated validation tests
- **`agents/skills/`** — Agent capability definitions

### 3. Validate Your Work

```bash
aps v1 validate repo
```

This checks:
- Required files exist
- Metadata is valid
- Naming conventions followed

### 4. Open a PR

- Use a descriptive title
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure `just check` passes

### 5. Promotion to Official Standard

After community review and iteration, experiments can be promoted:

```bash
aps v1 promote EXP-V1-XXXX
```

This moves the experiment to `standards/v1/APS-V1-XXXX-slug/`.
